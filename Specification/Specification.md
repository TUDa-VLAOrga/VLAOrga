# Specification for VLAOrga
## Project Description

The project VLAOrga is part of a practical lecture held at the Technical University in Darmstadt that aims at improving existing university systems or constructing new solutions.

### Domain

The "Vorlesungsassistenz Physik", which will from now on be abbreviated to VLA, of the physical department at TU Darmstadt is an essential part of ensuring that various physics based lectures can be held properly by ensuring that experiments are prepared before the lecture takes place. This very taks requires a lot of planning as a lectures do not have the time to prepare those experiments and one lecture might even contain multiple experiments.

For this purpose the VLA already has established a manual system in which they arrange themselves in a way that enables lecturers to receive their wished for experiments after requesting that very experiment via https://linus.iap.physik.tu-darmstadt.de/

For the VLA some dependencies on certain HRZ services i.e. the Ticketing system, Mails, etc. have proven to be unconvenient at times and are, as of now, a bottleneck for a seemless working environment.

### Current State
 
Following a prior project that allowed the VLA to store and manage information about their experiments within a data base via the aforementioned linus (see link above), the VLA requested us to further simplfy the process of organizing the deployment of experiments as well as reducing uncertainties that may arise due to natural miscommunication or analog on-the-fly communication.

As of now a large chunk of organizational communication is done using this very blackboard, printed mediums and hand-written notes.

Furthermore the VLA is, as of now, greatly hindered from doing their work efficiently as electronic mails are distributed on a per person basis instead of one central instance. This causes further effort in communicating what already has been worked on and what has not even been read yet making room for misinterpretations and errors. 

### Vision

With this project we aim at tackling those organizational bottlenecks by creating an easy to setup and maintaintable web application that can be used to greatly lessen miscommunication and improve on the VLA workflow for years to come.

An easy to use digital overview in the form of a central calendar with clickable lecture experiment overviews should replace the necessity for hand-written notes and printed out timetables. 

This calendar will not only serve its purpose in clearly displaying the different dates in a unified and easy to read format. An approach like this will also greatly lessen further misscommunication between the members of the VLA as everyone with appropriate access to the calendar will be able to see the latest modifications and an up-to-date view of the current organizational status using their phone.

The workflow of the VLA will also benefit from many quality of life improvements that will not only increase efficiency, but make certain tasks such as checking the current state of an specific experiment material or moving certain experiments between lectures much less of a hassle.
